## Introduction

This shiny pitch is intended to display the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) in the Coursera's Developing Data Products module.

My Approach to App creation:

_CLT basically says that the sampling distribution of the parent distribution will be tending towards normality irrespective of the population(parent) distribution as the sample size increases_

Building on this idea i have considered many differnt types of probability distributions namely:
  * Beta,Chi.squared,Exponential,F,Gamma,Lognormal,Normal,t,Uniform,Weibull)
  
I will taking the sampling distributions of the means to demonstrate CLT

## The Application

The purpose of this app is to simulate data and test the central limit theorem. To do that, you only need to follow the following steps:

  1. Choose one of the Eleven kinds of predefined population distributions;
  2. Specify a sample size on the slider ranging from 10 to 500 in steps of 10;
  3. Voila!---You can see the parent distribution as well as the sampling distribution displayed on the right panel.
